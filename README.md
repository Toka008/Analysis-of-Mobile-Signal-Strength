# Analyzing Mobile Signal Strength and Enhancing Network Performance

## Context
- Significant improvements in speed, capacity, and connectivity are represented by the transition of mobile communication from 2G to 5G. With so many functions they serve, mobile devices have become an integral part of our connected world. Call drops, sluggish data speeds, and poor connectivity continue to be problems even with advancements in technology. Our initiative aimed to maximize mobile connectivity by taking on these difficulties head-on. Our goals, methods, conclusions, application demonstration, and recommendations are summarized in this document. In addition, a video link demonstrating the web application we developed's attractive usage is offered.


## Expected Outcomes
- Analyze mobile signal strength data in detail.
- Make extensive use of ExploreAI's vast datasets to examine signal dynamics in detail.
- Investigate using machine learning to forecast the positions of cell towers.
- On the basis of analysis insights, offer recommendations for telco network optimization.
- Arrange mobile towers optimally to improve coverage and minimize interference.
- Strengthen network performance with recommendations based on data.

## Geospartial Analysis
- The study makes the considerable impact that tower clustering, cell tower distance, and mobile device proximity have on signal quality. Locations with subpar signal quality because of tower clustering or device placement at the tower edge were identified by a geospatial analysis.

## Population Density
- According to the investigation, Johannesburg's signal quality is often worse than that of other less populous towns and cities along the route, especially in heavily populated areas.

## Physical Obstruction
- Our observations led us to conclude that the signal quality is impacted by the proximity of large structures.

# Limitations
- The study's shortcomings include its unreliability due to insufficient data on cell tower height, antenna type, frequency, direction of signal propagation, and geographic dynamicity

## Recommendations
- The research indicates that monitoring the frequency data that cell towers communicate may improve network efficiency since it raises the possibility of receiving disruptive messages.
- The plan recommends improving signal strength, minimizing interference, and strategically spacing cell towers to optimize network performance.
- During the data gathering process, use real-time timestamp recording to capture dynamic datasets and enhance network strategy for efficient Time Series Analysis.

## Conclusion
- The distance between cell towers, population density, and physical obstructions are among the main factors affecting signal quality, as shown by ExploreAI's analysis of mobile signal strength data from Johannesburg to Cape Town.
- Using a thorough solution approach and data pipeline procedure, ExploreAI's unique tool was used to analyze and optimize network performance with an emphasis on tower clustering, population density, and building sizes.
- The study ended with suggestions for strengthening mobile signal strength, optimizing network performance, and refining algorithms, as well as providing insightful information for network design and improvement
